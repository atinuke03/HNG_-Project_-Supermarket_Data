The data shows sales pattern of 17 products grouped in 3 categories which are Furniture, Office supplies and Technology. The data set contains 13 columns and 9,995 rows. The aim of the analysis is to discover insights on market trends, top selling products and regions with highest sales, losses and profits made.

# Conclusion
The supermarket data analysis revealed the highest selling products such as phones, chairs, storage, table binders. Technology has the highest sales and profits while furniture has the highest loss. However, I recommend that:
1.	High performing products should be focused on to generate more sales.
2.	Strategic discount should be offered on slow-moving products to drive sales in some regions reporting low sales.
3.	Further market research should be done to identify reasons for low sales or lack of demand.
